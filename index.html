        <h3>Here's a time line of Dr.Borlaug's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Lowa</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program<br>known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving<br>Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes University a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles<br>Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the millitary after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the millitary asked his<br>lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to<br>head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1945</b> -  Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that<br>responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help<br>mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1970</b> - receives Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1983</b> -  helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops<br>are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently<br>dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called<br>it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
